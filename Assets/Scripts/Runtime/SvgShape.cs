    /// - An SVG drawing is often made of multiple elements (rect, path, circle, ...).
    ///   We convert each drawable element into a list of path commands (<see cref="commands"/>),

    /// - We keep a cached axis-aligned bounding box (<see cref="bounds"/>) to help with
    ///   layout, centering, and scaling in the preview control.
    /// - There is no behavior in this classâ€”it's purely data (a "model").
